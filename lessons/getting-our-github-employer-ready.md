## Github Profile

This is a relatively new addition to github.
Its essentially a simple website to add personality to your profile. Adding personality disarms.

## Plugins you can use
  - [Github Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
  - [Profile Views Counter](https://github.com/antonkomarev/github-profile-views-counter)

## Pinned Projects

Pinned Repos is a great way to ensure that the work you want to be seen gets looked at. Remember, people are lazy, use that to your advantage.

## Repo Activity

Repo Activity is a metric that is still unfortunately used. My advice: Continue adding features to one project show activity.
